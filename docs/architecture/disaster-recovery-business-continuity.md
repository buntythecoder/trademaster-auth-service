  dr_region: ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
  
  failover_triggers:
    - region_unavailable > 5_minutes
    - data_center_failure
    - network_partition > 10_minutes
  
  recovery_procedures:
    - dns_failover: automated (Route 53)
    - database_failover: automated (RDS Multi-AZ)
    - application_failover: manual_approval_required
```
