## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Stack**: Navigate to the appropriate directory
2. **Review Dependencies**: Check story dependencies before starting
3. **Coordinate Integration**: Plan integration points with other teams
4. **Follow Conventions**: Use technology-specific naming and patterns
5. **Update Progress**: Keep story status updated for coordination

## Next Steps

Each technology team can now focus on their domain-specific stories while maintaining clear integration points with other stacks.
