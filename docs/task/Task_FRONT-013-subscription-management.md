- **Mock mode:** Simulated billing for development without payment processing
- **Production mode:** Live payment gateway integration with real billing
- **Design Preservation:** No changes to existing glass-card styling and slate theme
- **Smart Context Switching:** Personal subscription view OR platform analytics view
