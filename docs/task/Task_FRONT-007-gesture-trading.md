**Smart Decisions Applied:**
- Trader-focused gesture library for quick execution

- Production mode: Live trading with mandatory confirmations
- Exclude complex admin gestures (not suitable for touch interface)
- Focus on mobile/tablet trading scenarios
- Include accessibility gestures for users with limitations
