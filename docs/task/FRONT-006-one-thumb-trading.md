## UI/UX Design Requirements

### Thumb Zone Optimization
```
Screen Layout (Right-handed):
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Information Display │ ← Safe zone, view-only
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Secondary Actions   │ ← Stretch zone, less frequent
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Primary Actions     │ ← Thumb zone, main interactions
│     [FAB]          │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Floating Action Design
- Primary FAB: Trade execution (buy/sell toggle)
- Speed dial actions:
  - Quick buy with smart quantity
  - Quick sell with position exit
  - Portfolio view
  - Watchlist access
  - Price alerts
  - Market status
  - Voice activation

### Visual Hierarchy
- High contrast for critical information
- Large fonts for readability while moving
- Color-coded actions (red=sell, green=buy)
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Minimal visual clutter
