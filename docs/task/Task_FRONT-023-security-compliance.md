**Smart Decisions Applied:**
- **Dual Context Views:** Trader security settings + Admin security monitoring
- **Theme Consistency:** Same glass morphism design for security interfaces
- **Role-Based Data:** Same security events with personal vs platform-wide threat analysis
- **Mock mode:** Simulated security events for testing without real threats
- **Production mode:** Live security monitoring with real threat detection
- **Design Preservation:** Existing admin glass-card styling and slate theme maintained
- **Smart Context Switching:** Personal security view OR platform threat monitoring view
