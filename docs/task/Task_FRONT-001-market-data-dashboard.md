**Smart Decisions Applied:**
- Focus on trader-centric features (order book, charts, real-time data)
- Mock mode: Simulated market data for development/testing without exchange fees
- Production mode: Live NSE/BSE feed integration with proper licensing
- Exclude admin market data management (not trader-facing)
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness for on-the-go trading
