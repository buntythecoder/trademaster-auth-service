**Smart Decisions Applied:**
- **Dual Context Views:** Trader AI recommendations + Admin ML system monitoring
- **Theme Consistency:** Same glass morphism design for AI interfaces
- **Role-Based Data:** Same ML predictions with personal vs platform-wide model performance
- **Mock mode:** Simulated AI responses for development without model serving
- **Production mode:** Live ML model integration with real predictions
- **Design Preservation:** Existing glass-card styling and slate theme maintained
- **Smart Context Switching:** Personal AI insights view OR platform ML operations view
