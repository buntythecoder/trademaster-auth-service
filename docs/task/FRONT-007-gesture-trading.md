- Multiple device sizes and orientations
- Hardware button integration
- Accessibility compliance for alternative inputs

## UI/UX Design Requirements

### Visual Feedback System
```typescript
interface GestureVisualFeedback {
  swipeTrail: AnimatedPath;        // Visual trail for swipes
  rippleEffect: TouchRipple;       // Touch feedback animation
  confirmationOverlay: ModalConfirm; // Trade confirmation
  gestureHints: TutorialOverlay;   // Learning assistance
  errorIndication: ErrorFeedback;  // Invalid gesture feedback
}
```

### Gesture Recognition Areas
```
Screen Gesture Zones:
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Portfolio (Swipe ↑) │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Buy (Swipe →)       │ ← Main trading area
│ Sell (Swipe ←)      │   with gesture recognition
├─────────────────────┤
│ Refresh (Swipe ↓)   │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Haptic Patterns
- Success: Double-tap vibration (100ms, 200ms)
- Error: Long buzz (500ms)
- Buy: Rising intensity pattern
- Sell: Descending intensity pattern
- Alert: Rhythmic pulse pattern

## Component Architecture

### Core Gesture Engine
```typescript
interface GestureEngine {
  swipeDetection: SwipeRecognizer;
  touchGestures: TouchGestureHandler;
  voiceCommands: VoiceCommandProcessor;
  hapticFeedback: HapticController;
  gestureCustomization: GesturePersonalization;
}
```

### Gesture Recognition System
```typescript
class GestureRecognizer {
  detectSwipe(touchEvent: TouchEvent): SwipeGesture | null;
  recognizeTouch(touches: Touch[]): TouchGesture | null;
  processVoice(audioInput: AudioData): VoiceCommand | null;
  triggerHaptic(pattern: HapticPattern): void;
  customizeGesture(user: User, gesture: CustomGesture): void;
}
```

### Trading Gesture Mapping
```typescript
interface TradingGestures {
  buy: SwipeRightGesture;
  sell: SwipeLeftGesture;
  portfolio: SwipeUpGesture;
  refresh: SwipeDownGesture;
  quickBuy: DoubleTapGesture;
  emergencyClose: ThreeFingerTapGesture;
  orderCancel: LongPressGesture;
