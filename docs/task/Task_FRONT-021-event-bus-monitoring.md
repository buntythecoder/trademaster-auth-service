**Smart Decisions Applied:**
- **Dual Context Events:** Same events with trader vs admin perspectives
- **Theme Consistency:** Maintain existing glass morphism design across both views
- **Role-Based Filtering:** Events filtered and contextualized by user role
- **Mock mode:** Simulated events for development without live event bus
- **Production mode:** Live AgentOS event bus integration
- **Smart Context Switching:** Events show trader impact OR admin operational impact
- **Existing Design Preservation:** No changes to current theme/design system
