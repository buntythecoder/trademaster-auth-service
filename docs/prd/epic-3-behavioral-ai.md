## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] AI models integrate with existing trading data from Epic 2
- [x] Behavioral insights enhance user profiles from Epic 1 without breaking existing functionality
- [x] Real-time processing works within existing Kafka streaming architecture
- [x] Dashboard components follow established mobile-first design patterns
