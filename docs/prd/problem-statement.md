# Problem Statement

## Current State and Pain Points

Indian retail traders face significant disadvantages in the market:

1. **Information Asymmetry:** Institutional traders have access to order flow data, regulatory intelligence, and market manipulation detection that retail traders cannot access
2. **Emotional Trading Losses:** Studies show 80%+ of retail traders lose money due to emotional decisions rather than market analysis failures
3. **Regulatory Complexity:** SEBI regulations are complex and constantly evolving, with traders often unaware of compliance requirements until violations occur
4. **Fragmented Tools:** Existing platforms focus on charting and execution but ignore behavioral psychology and institutional activity patterns
5. **Mobile Experience Gap:** Most Indian trading platforms provide poor mobile experiences despite mobile-first user behavior

## Impact Quantification

- Average retail trader loses 10-15% annually due to emotional trading decisions
- 90% of day traders lose money within their first year
- Regulatory non-compliance penalties can reach â‚¹1 crore+ for individual traders
- Institutional traders outperform retail by 3-8% annually due to information advantages

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Traditional Platforms:** Focus on execution speed and charting, ignore behavioral intervention
- **Robo-Advisors:** Provide passive management but no active trading intelligence
- **International Platforms:** Lack India-specific regulatory integration and market insights
- **Mobile Apps:** Simplified versions of desktop platforms, not mobile-native experiences

## Urgency and Importance

With 8+ crore demat accounts in India and growing retail participation post-COVID, the market timing is critical. New SEBI regulations around algorithmic trading and upcoming digital rupee integration create opportunities for compliant, intelligent platforms.
