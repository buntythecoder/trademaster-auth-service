# Epic 1: User Authentication & Security Foundation

## Epic Goal

Establish a secure, scalable user authentication and authorization system that meets financial industry security standards and provides the foundation for all TradeMaster trading features.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: New system - no existing authentication functionality
- Technology stack: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Security, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT tokens
- Integration points: API Gateway (Kong), Mobile apps (React Native), Web interface, Database layer

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added: Complete user authentication system with multi-factor authentication, session management, and security monitoring
- How it integrates: Provides authentication foundation for all API services and user interfaces
- Success criteria: Users can securely register, login, and maintain authenticated sessions with <100ms response times

## Stories

1. **Story 1.1: User Authentication & Security Foundation**
   - Implement core user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication
   - Set up multi-factor authentication (SMS, Email, TOTP)
   - Configure Spring Security with PostgreSQL user storage and Redis session management
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. User can register with email and password meeting security policy requirements
     2. User can login with valid credentials and receive JWT authentication tokens
     3. System enforces multi-factor authentication (SMS, Email, TOTP) for account security
     4. User sessions are managed securely with Redis-based session storage
     5. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
     6. API endpoints are protected with rate limiting and authentication validation
     7. System maintains audit logs for all authentication and authorization events
     8. Password policies are enforced (complexity, rotation, history)
     9. Device fingerprinting and suspicious activity detection are implemented
     10. System integrates with Spring Security for role-based access control (RBAC)

2. **Story 1.2: User Profile Management & KYC Integration**
   - Implement user profile creation and management functionality
   - Integrate KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process for SEBI compliance
   - Set up subscription tier management for freemium model
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. Users can create and update their trading profiles with personal information
     2. System integrates with KYC verification service for regulatory compliance
     3. User subscription tiers (free, smart trader, professional, institutional) are managed
     4. Profile data is encrypted and stored securely in PostgreSQL
     5. Users can set trading preferences and risk tolerance levels
     6. System tracks KYC status and enforces trading limits based on verification level
     7. Profile changes are logged for audit and compliance purposes

3. **Story 1.3: API Gateway Security Integration**
   - Configure Kong API Gateway with authentication and rate limiting
   - Implement tiered rate limiting based on subscription levels
   - Set up request/response transformation and security headers
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. API Gateway validates JWT tokens for all protected endpoints
     2. Rate limiting enforced per subscription tier (free: 100/min, premium: 5000/min)
     3. Security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS) are properly configured
     4. Request routing and load balancing work correctly across auth services
     5. Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures
     6. API versioning and backward compatibility are maintained
     7. Gateway logs all authentication and authorization events for monitoring

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Database schema follows PostgreSQL best practices with proper indexing
- [x] API design follows RESTful standards for future expansion
- [x] JWT token format supports additional claims for user roles and permissions
- [x] Session management scales horizontally with Redis clustering
- [x] Security implementation meets financial industry compliance standards

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in authentication system could compromise entire platform
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement comprehensive security testing including penetration testing
- Follow OWASP security guidelines and financial industry best practices
- Use established Spring Security framework rather than custom authentication
- Implement comprehensive audit logging and monitoring

**Rollback Plan:** 
- Maintain database migration rollback scripts
- Use feature flags to disable authentication features if critical issues arise
- Implement graceful degradation to basic authentication if advanced features fail
- Maintain backup authentication service configuration

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Authentication system handles 10,000+ concurrent users
- [x] Security testing completed including vulnerability scanning
- [x] Performance testing confirms <100ms authentication response times
- [x] Audit logging captures all security-relevant events
- [x] Documentation updated for API endpoints and security procedures
- [x] Integration testing with mobile and web clients successful
- [x] SEBI compliance requirements verified for KYC and user data handling

## Technical Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- NSE/BSE market data access (requires authenticated users)
