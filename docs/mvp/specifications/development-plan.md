## Development Strategy

### MVP Focus Areas
Based on the comprehensive analysis in `docs/pending-work/COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md`, 85% of pending work is frontend implementation using existing backend APIs.

**Critical Path to Revenue:**
1. **Frontend Core** (4-6 weeks) - Revenue blocking priority
2. **Mobile PWA** (3-4 weeks) - User experience priority  
3. **Revenue Systems** (2-3 weeks) - Business sustainability
4. **AI Infrastructure** (8-12 weeks) - Differentiation advantage

### Development Principles
- **Mobile-First Development**: 85% of users will be on mobile
- **Existing Backend Leverage**: Use production-ready backend APIs
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features first, advanced features later
- **Real-time Focus**: Live data updates and WebSocket integration
- **Existing Design System**: Build on TradeMaster's glassmorphism theme
