## FE-015: Multi-Broker Portfolio Aggregation

**As a** trader with positions across multiple brokers  
**I want to** see my complete portfolio consolidated in real-time  
**So that** I have a unified view of my entire investment portfolio

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Real-time Portfolio Consolidation  
- **Given** I have positions across 3+ brokers  
- **When** I view the portfolio dashboard  
- **Then** I see aggregated data:  
  - Total portfolio value across all brokers  
  - Combined unrealized P&L  
  - Real-time updates as prices change  
  - Broker-wise contribution breakdown  
  - Asset allocation summary

#### AC2: Position-level Aggregation  
- **Given** I hold the same stock in multiple brokers  
- **When** viewing position details  
- **Then** I see:  
  - Combined quantity across brokers  
  - Weighted average purchase price  
  - Consolidated P&L calculation  
  - Individual broker position breakdown  
  - Ability to view/hide broker-level details

#### AC3: Historical Portfolio Tracking

- **When** viewing historical data  
- **Then** I can see:  
  - Portfolio value timeline (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y)  
  - P&L progression charts  
  - Asset allocation changes over time  
  - Broker contribution trends

- `ConsolidatedHoldingsList` with expand/collapse
- `PortfolioTimelineChart` with historical performance

### Testing Scenarios

**Aggregation Accuracy**:
1. Same stock in 2 brokers → correct combined quantity and avg price
2. Different lot sizes → proper aggregation handling
3. Partial positions → accurate fractional calculations
4. Corporate actions → consistent treatment across brokers

**Real-time Updates**:
1. Price changes → portfolio value updates immediately
2. New trade executed → portfolio reflects within 30 seconds
3. Broker sync issue → clear indication and graceful handling
4. Multiple simultaneous updates → no race conditions

**Data Visualization**:
- Portfolio timeline shows accurate historical progression
- Broker breakdown percentages add up to 100%
- Asset allocation categories reflect current holdings
- Charts responsive and accessible on mobile

**Performance Requirements**:
- Portfolio calculation completes in <200ms
- Dashboard loads with 50+ holdings in <2 seconds
- Real-time updates don't block UI interactions
- Memory usage optimized for large portfolios

**Story Points**: 5 (High complexity, core feature)  
**Dependencies**: Position aggregation service, real-time price data, broker APIs  
**Risks**: Data accuracy across brokers, real-time performance, calculation complexity

  weight: number
  performance: number
}
```

**Analytics Calculations**:

4. Attribution analysis → sector contributions sum correctly

**Chart Functionality**:
1. Time range selection → chart updates with correct data
2. Benchmark overlay → shows portfolio vs index performance
3. Interactive tooltips → display accurate data points
4. Mobile responsiveness → charts readable on small screens

**Performance Edge Cases**:
- New portfolio (< 30 days) → appropriate messaging for limited data

- Zero or negative returns → proper handling and display

**Story Points**: 5 (High complexity, analytical feature)  
**Dependencies**: Historical price data, benchmark data, performance calculation service  
**Risks**: Calculation complexity, data quality, chart performance
