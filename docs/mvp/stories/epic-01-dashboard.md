## FE-001: Real-Time Market Data Display

**As a** trader managing multiple broker accounts  
**I want to** see live price updates for all my tracked symbols  
**So that** I can make informed trading decisions without switching platforms

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Live Price Updates  
- **Given** I have symbols in my watchlist  
- **When** market prices change  
- **Then** I see price updates within 100ms  
- **And** price changes are visually highlighted (green for up, red for down)  
- **And** percentage changes are displayed with proper formatting

#### AC2: Multi-Exchange Support  
- **Given** I track symbols from NSE and BSE  
- **When** viewing the dashboard  
- **Then** I see prices from both exchanges clearly labeled  
- **And** exchange-specific data like volume and last traded time

#### AC3: Market Hours Handling  
- **Given** markets are closed  
- **When** viewing prices  
- **Then** I see "Market Closed" status  
- **And** previous close prices with "as of" timestamps  
- **And** next market opening time

### Technical Requirements

```typescript
interface MarketDataDisplay {
  symbol: string
  exchange: 'NSE' | 'BSE'
  currentPrice: number
  change: number
  changePercent: number
  volume: number
  lastTradeTime: Date
  marketStatus: 'OPEN' | 'CLOSED' | 'PRE_MARKET' | 'AFTER_MARKET'
}
```

**Components Needed**:
- `PriceDisplayCard` with real-time updates
- `MarketStatusIndicator` for market hours
- `PriceChangeIndicator` with color coding

**WebSocket Integration**:
- Subscribe to price updates on component mount
- Handle connection failures with retry logic
- Batch updates for performance optimization

### Testing Scenarios

**Happy Path**:
1. User opens dashboard â†’ sees current prices
2. Price changes â†’ updates reflected immediately  
3. Market closes â†’ status changes to closed

**Edge Cases**:
1. WebSocket disconnection â†’ shows "connecting" status
2. Invalid symbol data â†’ displays error state gracefully
3. High-frequency updates â†’ throttling prevents UI lag

**Performance**:
- Price updates render in <50ms
- Dashboard handles 100+ symbols without lag
- Memory usage stays under 100MB

**Story Points**: 5 (Medium complexity, critical feature)  
**Dependencies**: WebSocket service, market data API  
**Risks**: WebSocket reliability, performance with many symbols
