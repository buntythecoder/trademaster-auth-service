## BE-009: Multi-Broker Connection Management

**As a** trader using multiple brokers  
**I want** seamless connection management across all my broker accounts  
**So that** I can trade without worrying about connection issues or manual reconnections

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Broker Account Integration  
- **Given** I want to connect my broker accounts  
- **When** I initiate broker setup  
- **Then** I can connect multiple brokers:  
  - OAuth integration for Zerodha, Groww, Angel One  
  - Secure token management with auto-refresh  
  - Account validation with test API calls  
  - Portfolio sync verification  
  - Real-time connection status display

#### AC2: Connection Health Monitoring  
- **Given** I have multiple brokers connected  
- **When** using the platform  
- **Then** I see real-time connection status:  
  - Connection health indicators (green/yellow/red)  
  - Last sync timestamps  
  - API response time monitoring  
  - Error rate tracking per broker  
  - Automatic reconnection attempts

#### AC3: Intelligent Failover Management  
- **Given** a broker connection fails  
- **When** I attempt to trade or fetch data  
- **Then** the system handles failover:  
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff  
  - Switch to backup broker for similar orders  
  - Queue operations during temporary failures  
  - User notification of connection issues  
  - Manual failover controls for critical situations

### Technical Requirements

```typescript
// Broker Connection Manager
interface BrokerConnection {
  brokerId: string
  brokerName: string
  status: ConnectionStatus
  credentials: EncryptedCredentials
  lastSync: Date
  healthMetrics: BrokerHealthMetrics
  capabilities: BrokerCapabilities
}

interface BrokerHealthMetrics {
  responseTime: number        // Average API response time (ms)
  successRate: number        // Success rate (0-1)
  errorRate: number          // Error rate per hour
  uptime: number             // Uptime percentage (0-1)
  lastError?: BrokerError
  connectionQuality: 'EXCELLENT' | 'GOOD' | 'POOR' | 'CRITICAL'
}

interface BrokerCapabilities {
  supportedOrderTypes: OrderType[]
  supportedExchanges: string[]
  maxOrderSize: number
  rateLimit: RateLimitConfig
  features: BrokerFeature[]
}

// Connection Status Management
enum ConnectionStatus {
  CONNECTED = 'connected',
  CONNECTING = 'connecting',
  DISCONNECTED = 'disconnected',
  ERROR = 'error',
  MAINTENANCE = 'maintenance'
}

interface ConnectionManager {
  establishConnection(brokerConfig: BrokerConfig): Promise<BrokerConnection>
  monitorHealth(): void
  handleFailover(brokerId: string): Promise<BrokerConnection>
  retryConnection(brokerId: string): Promise<boolean>
  getConnectionStatus(): BrokerConnection[]
}

// Failover Strategy
interface FailoverStrategy {
  primaryBroker: string
  backupBrokers: string[]
  failoverRules: FailoverRule[]
  recoveryConfig: RecoveryConfig
}

interface FailoverRule {
  condition: 'TIMEOUT' | 'ERROR_RATE' | 'MANUAL'
  threshold: number
  action: 'RETRY' | 'SWITCH' | 'QUEUE'
  targetBroker?: string
}
```

**Connection Management Features**:
- **OAuth Flow**: Secure broker authentication with PKCE
- **Token Management**: Automatic refresh with encrypted storage
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time connection quality assessment
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures across brokers
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across healthy brokers

**Components Needed**:
- `BrokerConnectionCard` with real-time status indicators
- `ConnectionHealthDashboard` showing metrics and trends
- `BrokerSetupWizard` for OAuth integration flow
- `FailoverControls` for manual broker switching
- `ConnectionDiagnostics` for troubleshooting issues

### Testing Scenarios

**Connection Establishment**:
1. OAuth flow → successful broker connection
2. Invalid credentials → clear error messages
3. Network issues → retry with exponential backoff
4. Multiple simultaneous connections → proper resource management

**Health Monitoring**:
1. Healthy connections → green status indicators
2. Slow responses → yellow warning status
3. Connection failures → red error status with details
4. Intermittent issues → proper status transitions

**Failover Testing**:
1. Primary broker fails → automatic switch to backup
2. All brokers fail → graceful degradation with user notification
3. Recovery scenarios → seamless restoration of services
4. Manual failover → immediate switch with confirmation

**Security Validation**:
- OAuth tokens encrypted at rest
- API credentials never logged or exposed
- Secure token refresh without user intervention
- Session management with proper expiration

**Performance Requirements**:
- Connection establishment within 10 seconds
- Health monitoring with <500ms status updates
- Failover execution within 3 seconds
- Support for 5+ concurrent broker connections

**Story Points**: 6 (High complexity, critical infrastructure)  
**Dependencies**: OAuth integration, encryption service, broker APIs  
**Risks**: Broker API limitations, OAuth flow complexity, connection stability
