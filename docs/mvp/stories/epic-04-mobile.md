  }
  timestamp: number
}

// Haptic Feedback Patterns
enum HapticType {
  LIGHT = 'light',          // Gesture recognition
  MEDIUM = 'medium',        // Action preview
  HEAVY = 'heavy',          // Action confirmation
  SUCCESS = 'success',      // Trade execution
  WARNING = 'warning',      // Risk warning
  ERROR = 'error'           // Action failed
}
```

**Gesture Implementation**:
- **Touch Event Handling**: Custom gesture recognizer with velocity and direction detection
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth animations showing gesture progress and outcome

## FE-021: Offline Trading Capabilities

**As a** mobile trader in areas with poor connectivity  
**I want** core functionality to work offline  
**So that** I can still monitor my portfolio and queue trades during network issues

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Offline Portfolio Viewing  
- **Given** I have previously loaded my portfolio  
- **When** my network connection is lost  
- **Then** I can still:  
  - View my cached portfolio positions  
  - See last known prices with "offline" indicators  
  - Access order history and transaction details  
  - Review portfolio analytics with cached data  
  - Navigate between cached screens smoothly

#### AC2: Order Queuing When Offline  
- **Given** I want to place trades while offline  
- **When** I submit an order  
- **Then** the system:  
  - Accepts the order and queues it locally  
  - Shows "queued for execution" status  
  - Validates order against cached data  
  - Displays estimated execution when online  
  - Automatically submits when connectivity returns

#### AC3: Intelligent Data Synchronization  
- **Given** I return online after being offline  
- **When** connectivity is restored  
- **Then** the app:  
  - Syncs queued orders automatically  
  - Updates all prices and positions  
  - Shows notification of completed sync  
  - Resolves any conflicts intelligently  
  - Maintains user context and navigation state

### Technical Requirements

```typescript
// Offline Storage Strategy
interface OfflineStorage {
  portfolio: CachedPortfolio
  orders: QueuedOrder[]
  prices: CachedPrices
  userPreferences: UserSettings
  analytics: CachedAnalytics
  lastSync: Date
}

// Queued Order Structure
interface QueuedOrder {
  id: string
  order: OrderRequest
  queuedAt: Date
  status: 'QUEUED' | 'SYNCING' | 'EXECUTED' | 'FAILED'
  retryCount: number
  validUntil: Date
  conflictResolution?: 'USER_CONFIRM' | 'AUTO_CANCEL'
}

// Sync Strategy
interface SyncManager {
  syncPortfolio(): Promise<SyncResult>
  syncOrders(): Promise<OrderSyncResult[]>
  syncPrices(): Promise<PriceSyncResult>
  resolveConflicts(conflicts: Conflict[]): Promise<Resolution[]>
  prioritizeSync(): SyncPriority[]
}

// Offline Indicators
enum OfflineStatus {
  ONLINE = 'online',
  OFFLINE = 'offline',
  SYNCING = 'syncing',
  CONFLICT = 'conflict',
  ERROR = 'error'
}
```

**Offline Implementation Strategy**:
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Structured storage for portfolio, orders, and market data
- **Service Worker**: Background sync when connectivity returns
- **Intelligent Caching**: Priority-based caching of critical data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of stale data conflicts
- **Queue Management**: FIFO order execution with validation

**Components Needed**:
- `OfflineIndicator` showing connection and sync status
- `QueuedOrdersList` displaying pending orders
- `SyncProgress` showing synchronization status
- `ConflictResolver` for handling data conflicts
- `OfflinePortfolio` with cached data display

### Testing Scenarios

**Offline Functionality**:
1. Go offline → app continues to work with cached data
2. View portfolio → shows last known data with offline indicators
3. Attempt navigation → cached screens load instantly
4. Try to trade → order gets queued with confirmation

**Order Queuing**:
1. Place order offline → order added to queue
2. Multiple orders → queue maintains order priority
3. Invalid order offline → validation works with cached data
4. Queue persistence → survives app restart

**Online Synchronization**:
1. Network returns → automatic sync begins
2. Queued orders → execute in correct sequence
3. Data conflicts → user prompted for resolution
4. Sync completion → user notified of results

**Edge Cases**:
- App closed while offline → queue persists
- Partial sync failure → retry mechanism works
- Stale price data → user warned about outdated prices
- Large sync after long offline → progressive sync with priority

**Performance Requirements**:
- Offline app feels as fast as online version
- Sync completes within 10 seconds for typical portfolio
- Queue can handle 100+ pending orders
- Storage usage stays under 50MB for typical user

**Story Points**: 2 (Low-medium complexity, nice-to-have)  
**Dependencies**: IndexedDB storage, background sync APIs, service worker  
**Risks**: Data consistency, storage limitations, sync complexity
