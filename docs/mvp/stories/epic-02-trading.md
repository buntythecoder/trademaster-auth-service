## FE-009: Order Placement Form

**As a** trader with multiple broker accounts  
**I want to** place orders through a unified interface  
**So that** I can execute trades without switching between broker platforms

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Complete Order Entry Form  
- **Given** I want to place a trade  
- **When** I access the order form  
- **Then** I can enter:  
  - Symbol (with auto-complete)  
  - Order type (Market, Limit, Stop-Loss, Stop-Loss Market)  
  - Side (Buy/Sell)  
  - Quantity (with lot size validation)  
  - Price (for limit orders)  
  - Trigger price (for SL orders)  
  - Validity (Day, IOC, GTC)

#### AC2: Real-time Order Preview  
- **Given** I'm filling out an order form  
- **When** I enter order details  
- **Then** I see real-time preview showing:  
  - Estimated total cost including brokerage  
  - Margin requirements  
  - Available cash/margin  
  - Estimated execution time  
  - Risk assessment

#### AC3: Form Validation  
- **Given** I'm entering order details  
- **When** I input invalid data  
- **Then** I see immediate validation feedback:  
  - Symbol must be valid and tradeable  
  - Quantity must be in valid lot sizes  
  - Price must be within daily limits  
  - Insufficient funds warning  
  - Market hours validation

### Technical Requirements

```typescript
interface OrderForm {
  symbol: string
  exchange: string
  side: 'BUY' | 'SELL'
  orderType: 'MARKET' | 'LIMIT' | 'SL' | 'SL_MARKET'
  quantity: number
  price?: number
  triggerPrice?: number
  validity: 'DAY' | 'IOC' | 'GTC'
  brokerPreference?: string
}

interface OrderPreview {
  estimatedCost: number
  brokerage: number
  taxes: number
  totalCost: number
  marginRequired: number
  availableMargin: number
  riskScore: number
  estimatedExecutionTime: number
}
```

**Components Needed**:
- `OrderEntryForm` with controlled inputs
- `SymbolInput` with auto-complete integration
- `OrderTypeSelector` with conditional fields
- `OrderPreview` with real-time calculations
- `ValidationMessage` for form errors

**Form Validation Rules**:
- Symbol exists and is tradeable
- Quantity is positive and in lot multiples
- Price within circuit limits (Â±10% for most stocks)
- Sufficient funds/margin available
- Market hours compliance

### Testing Scenarios

**Form Completion Flow**:
1. Enter "RELIANCE" â†’ auto-complete shows suggestions
2. Select "BUY" â†’ form updates for buy order
3. Enter quantity "100" â†’ validates lot size
4. Choose "LIMIT" â†’ price field becomes required
5. Enter price â†’ preview updates with costs

**Validation Testing**:
1. Invalid symbol â†’ shows "Symbol not found" error
2. Quantity not in lot size â†’ shows lot size requirement
3. Price beyond limits â†’ shows circuit limit warning
4. Insufficient funds â†’ shows available balance
5. After market hours â†’ shows market closed warning

**Real-time Preview**:
- Price changes â†’ preview updates immediately
- Quantity changes â†’ total cost recalculated
- Order type changes â†’ relevant fields shown/hidden
- Brokerage calculation â†’ accurate for each broker

**Story Points**: 5 (Medium complexity, core UX)  
**Dependencies**: Symbol validation API, order preview API, real-time price data  
**Risks**: Form complexity, validation accuracy, mobile UX

## FE-010: Smart Order Routing Engine

**As a** trader using multiple brokers  
**I want** intelligent order routing recommendations  
**So that** I get the best execution price and speed for my trades

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Routing Algorithm Display  
- **Given** I've entered a valid order  
- **When** I request routing analysis  
- **Then** I see AI-powered routing suggestions:  
  - Recommended broker(s) for execution  
  - Reasoning for each recommendation  
  - Estimated execution quality scores  
  - Cost breakdown by broker  
  - Execution time estimates

#### AC2: Multi-Broker Order Splitting  
- **Given** I have a large order (>â‚¹5L value)  
- **When** routing analysis runs  
- **Then** system may suggest splitting across brokers:  
  - Optimal quantity allocation per broker  
  - Risk distribution benefits  
  - Total cost optimization  
  - Coordinated execution plan

#### AC3: Real-time Routing Updates  
- **Given** market conditions change while reviewing routing  
- **When** liquidity or prices shift  
- **Then** routing recommendations update automatically:  
  - New broker rankings if applicable  
  - Updated cost estimates  
  - Execution time adjustments  
  - Risk score modifications

### Technical Requirements

```typescript
interface OrderRoute {
  brokerId: string
  brokerName: string
  allocation: number // quantity to route to this broker
  estimatedCost: number
  executionScore: number // 0-100 quality score
  estimatedTime: number // seconds
  reasoning: string[]
  riskFactors: string[]
}

interface RoutingPlan {
  totalCost: number
  totalTime: number
  riskScore: number
  savings: number // vs worst option
  routes: OrderRoute[]
  strategy: 'SINGLE' | 'SPLIT' | 'SEQUENTIAL'
}

interface RoutingFactors {
  liquidity: number
  brokerage: number
  speed: number
  reliability: number
  marketImpact: number
}
```

**Routing Algorithm Logic**:
1. **Liquidity Analysis**: Check available liquidity per broker
2. **Cost Optimization**: Compare total costs including brokerage
3. **Speed Assessment**: Historical execution time analysis
4. **Risk Evaluation**: Broker reliability and market impact
5. **Smart Splitting**: For large orders, optimize across brokers

**Components Needed**:
- `SmartRoutingDisplay` with route visualization
- `RouteCard` showing individual broker routes
- `RoutingMetrics` with execution scores
- `RouteSplitVisualizer` for multi-broker orders
- `ExecutionPlan` with timeline

### Testing Scenarios

**Single Broker Routing**:
1. Small order (â‚¹50K) â†’ recommends best single broker
2. Market order â†’ prioritizes speed over cost
3. Limit order â†’ balances cost and likelihood of fill
4. High volatility â†’ factors in execution risk

**Multi-Broker Splitting**:
1. Large order (â‚¹10L) â†’ suggests splitting across 2-3 brokers
2. Low liquidity stock â†’ splits to minimize market impact
3. High-frequency trading â†’ coordinates simultaneous execution
4. Risk-averse user â†’ emphasizes risk distribution

**Real-time Adaptation**:
- Price moves against order â†’ updates routing recommendation
- Broker goes offline â†’ removes from routing options
- Liquidity changes â†’ adjusts allocation percentages
- Market volatility increases â†’ updates risk scores

**Algorithm Performance**:
- Routing calculation completes in <500ms
- Recommendations beat random broker selection by >15%
- User accepts routing suggestions >70% of time
- Cost savings average â‚¹200+ per â‚¹1L order

**Story Points**: 8 (High complexity, core differentiator)  
**Dependencies**: Broker API integration, historical execution data, market data feeds  
**Risks**: Algorithm complexity, real-time performance, broker data quality

2. Moderate leverage â†’ medium risk score (30-70)
3. High concentration â†’ high risk score (70-100)
4. Multiple risk factors â†’ compound scoring

**User Experience**:
1. All validations pass â†’ green "Place Order" button
2. Warnings only â†’ yellow "Place Order" with acknowledgment
3. Critical errors â†’ disabled button with fix suggestions
4. Educational content â†’ links to learn about trading rules

**Story Points**: 3 (Medium complexity, important safety feature)  
**Dependencies**: Portfolio data, regulatory rules engine, market data  
**Risks**: Over-conservative validation, regulatory rule changes
