### AI Service Architecture
**Source: [docs/architecture/aiml-services-architecture.md#1-behavioral-ai-service]**

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.11, TensorFlow/PyTorch, FastAPI
- GPU-enabled containers for ML inference
- Apache Kafka for real-time event processing

**Core ML Models:**
- **Emotional State Predictor:** LSTM model analyzing trading patterns
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** Gradient boosting for position risk scoring
- **Pattern Recognition:** CNN for chart pattern and behavioral analysis
- **Decision Intervention:** Real-time classification of trading decisions

**Model Pipeline Implementation:**
```python
class BehavioralAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.emotion_model = load_model('emotion_lstm')
        self.risk_model = load_model('risk_gradient_boost')
        self.pattern_model = load_model('pattern_cnn')

        # Real-time behavioral analysis
        # Risk assessment and intervention
        # Pattern matching against historical data
        return behavioral_insights
```

### Behavioral Pattern Detection
**Pattern Categories to Detect:**
- **Impulsive Trading:** Rapid trade execution without analysis
- **Revenge Trading:** Increasing position sizes after losses
- **Overconfidence:** Position sizing increases after wins  
- **Loss Aversion:** Holding losing positions too long
- **Herding Behavior:** Following crowd sentiment blindly
- **Anchoring Bias:** Over-reliance on specific price points
- **Confirmation Bias:** Selective information processing

**Pattern Detection Algorithms:**
```python
class PatternDetector:
    def detect_impulsive_trading(self, trades, time_threshold=300):
        # Analyze time between analysis and execution
        # Flag trades executed within 5 minutes of market event
        # Consider volatility context and normal user behavior
        return impulsive_score
    
    def detect_revenge_trading(self, trades, loss_threshold=0.05):
        # Identify increasing position sizes after losses
        # Analyze emotional state indicators
        # Consider risk management violations
        return revenge_score
```

### LSTM Model Architecture
**Emotional State Prediction Model:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

class EmotionalStateLSTM:
    def build_model(self, sequence_length, features):
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, features)),
            Dropout(0.2),
            LSTM(64, return_sequences=False),
            Dropout(0.2),
            Dense(32, activation='relu'),
            Dense(3, activation='softmax')  # fear, greed, neutral
        ])
        return model
    
    def preprocess_trading_sequence(self, trades, market_data):
        # Create sequences of trading behavior with market context
        # Include timing, sizing, and outcome features
        # Normalize features for model input
        return sequences, labels
```
