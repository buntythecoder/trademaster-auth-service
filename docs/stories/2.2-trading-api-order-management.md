- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (transactional), Redis 7+ (caching)
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka for order events and notifications
- **Integration**: REST APIs for broker connectivity
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, distributed tracing

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Multi-Broker Trading Integration
**Given** configured broker accounts (Zerodha, Upstox, Angel Broking)  
**When** users place orders through the platform  
**Then** the system should:
- ✅ Route orders to user's preferred broker
- ✅ Handle broker-specific authentication (OAuth2, API keys)
- ✅ Normalize order responses across different brokers
- ✅ Implement failover to secondary brokers
- ✅ Track order status across multiple broker platforms

**Validation Criteria**:
- Support minimum 3 major brokers
- Order routing success rate ≥99.5%
- Failover response time <5 seconds
- Order status synchronization within 1 second

### AC-2: Comprehensive Order Types
**Given** authenticated users with trading permissions  
**When** placing different types of orders  
**Then** the system should support:
- ✅ **Basic Orders**: Market, Limit, Stop-Loss, Stop-Limit
- ✅ **Advanced Orders**: Good Till Cancelled (GTC), Fill or Kill (FOK), Immediate or Cancel (IOC)
- ✅ **Bracket Orders**: Entry, target, and stop-loss in single order
- ✅ **Cover Orders**: Market order with compulsory stop-loss
- ✅ **Algorithmic Orders**: TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg orders

**Validation Criteria**:
- Support 15+ order types with proper validation
- Order parameter validation accuracy 100%
- Complex order logic execution correctness ≥99.9%
- Order modification and cancellation within 500ms

### AC-3: Real-time Order Management
**Given** active orders in the system  
**When** monitoring order status and execution  
**Then** the system should provide:
- ✅ Real-time order status updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Order book management with position tracking
- ✅ Partial fill handling and aggregation
- ✅ Order history and trade confirmations
- ✅ Position reconciliation across brokers

**Validation Criteria**:
- Order status update latency <100ms
- WebSocket message delivery guarantee 99.99%
- Position accuracy verification 100%
- Trade confirmation within 5 seconds

### AC-4: Advanced Risk Management
**Given** trading operations and market conditions  
**When** evaluating risk exposure  
**Then** the system should implement:
- ✅ **Pre-trade Risk Checks**: Margin validation, position limits, exposure limits
- ✅ **Real-time Risk Monitoring**: P&L tracking, VAR calculation, drawdown limits
- ✅ **Automated Risk Actions**: Position squaring, margin calls, trading restrictions
- ✅ **Circuit Breakers**: Individual and portfolio-level loss limits
- ✅ **Compliance Monitoring**: SEBI risk guidelines and regulatory limits

**Validation Criteria**:
- Pre-trade risk check latency <50ms
- Risk limit enforcement accuracy 100%
- Automated risk action execution <10 seconds
- Compliance violation detection rate 100%

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: 95%+ line coverage
- **Focus Areas**: Order validation, risk calculations, execution logic
