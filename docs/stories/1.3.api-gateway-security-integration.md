# Story 1.3: API Gateway Security Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** TradeMaster system administrator and user,
**I want** a secure API Gateway that validates authentication, enforces subscription-based rate limiting, and provides comprehensive security controls,
**so that** the platform is protected from unauthorized access, abuse, and security threats while providing optimal performance for legitimate users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API Gateway validates JWT tokens for all protected endpoints
2. Rate limiting enforced per subscription tier (free: 100/min, premium: 5000/min)
3. Security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS) are properly configured
4. Request routing and load balancing work correctly across auth services
5. Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures
6. API versioning and backward compatibility are maintained
7. Gateway logs all authentication and authorization events for monitoring
