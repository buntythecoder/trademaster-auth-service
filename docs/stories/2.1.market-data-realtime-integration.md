5. Historical price data is accessible through REST API endpoints
6. Market data permissions are enforced based on user subscription tiers
7. System handles market closure periods and holiday schedules appropriately
8. Price alerts and notifications are triggered based on user-defined criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** Authentication system provides secure user sessions and subscription tier management that will be used for market data access control and rate limiting.

### Data Models
**Source: [docs/architecture/data-architecture.md#influxdb-time-series-market-data]**

**InfluxDB Schema for Market Data:**
```sql
-- Price data measurement
price,symbol=RELIANCE,exchange=NSE value=2450.50,volume=1000000 1609459200000000000

-- Behavioral events measurement  
behavior,user_id=123,event_type=emotional_trade confidence=0.85,risk_score=7.2 1609459200000000000

-- Institutional activity measurement
institutional,symbol=TCS,activity_type=accumulation strength=8.5,volume_ratio=3.2 1609459200000000000
```

**Redis Caching Schema:**
```yaml
cache_layers:
  user_sessions: 24h_ttl
  market_data: 5s_ttl
  portfolio_data: 30s_ttl
  behavioral_models: 1h_ttl
  compliance_rules: 4h_ttl
```

### API Specifications
**Source: [docs/architecture/core-services-architecture.md#4-market-data-service]**

**Technology Stack:**
- Spring Boot with WebSocket support
- Apache Kafka for streaming data processing
- InfluxDB for time-series data storage
- Redis for real-time caching

**Market Data API Endpoints (to be implemented):**
- `GET /api/v1/market-data/price/{symbol}` - Current price data
- `GET /api/v1/market-data/history/{symbol}` - Historical price data
- `GET /api/v1/market-data/ohlcv/{symbol}` - OHLCV aggregated data
- `WebSocket /ws/market-data` - Real-time price streams
- `POST /api/v1/market-data/alerts` - Price alert management

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
```
Market Data Sources → Kafka → Stream Processing → InfluxDB
                                      ↓
                              Real-time WebSocket → Clients
```

### Market Data Integration
**Source: [docs/architecture/core-services-architecture.md#4-market-data-service]**

**Data Sources:**
- NSE/BSE real-time feeds
- MCX commodity data  
- Cryptocurrency exchange APIs
- Economic calendar and news feeds

**Features to implement:**
- Market data normalization across exchanges
- Real-time price alerts and notifications

### Kafka Streaming Architecture
**Source: [docs/architecture/data-architecture.md#real-time-stream-processing]**

**Kafka Topics:**

- `market-data-processed`: Cleaned and normalized data
- `user-behavior-events`: Trading actions and UI interactions
- `institutional-alerts`: Detected institutional activity
- `compliance-events`: Regulatory compliance checks

**Stream Processing Example:**
```java
@Component
public class MarketDataProcessor {
    
    @KafkaListener(topics = "market-data-raw")
    public void processRawData(MarketDataEvent event) {
        // Data validation and normalization
        // Real-time analysis and alerting
        // Store to InfluxDB
        // Broadcast to WebSocket clients
    }
}
```

### File Locations
**Project Structure:** Based on Spring Boot microservices architecture:
- `src/main/java/com/trademaster/marketdata/` - Market data service classes
- `src/main/java/com/trademaster/marketdata/service/` - Business logic services
- `src/main/java/com/trademaster/marketdata/controller/` - REST API controllers

- `src/main/java/com/trademaster/marketdata/kafka/` - Kafka producers and consumers
- `src/main/java/com/trademaster/marketdata/model/` - Data models and DTOs
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` - Service configuration
- `src/test/java/` - Test classes following same package structure

### Performance Requirements
**Source: [docs/architecture/performance-scalability.md#performance-targets]**

**API Performance Targets:**
- Market data retrieval: <50ms response time
- WebSocket message delivery: <100ms latency  
- Redis cache queries: <5ms response time

### Technical Constraints
**Source: [docs/architecture/core-services-architecture.md#4-market-data-service]**

**Technology Requirements:**
- Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.x framework
- Apache Kafka for high-throughput streaming

- **Professional:** Full real-time access, advanced data feeds, higher API limits
- **Institutional:** Real-time data for all symbols, unlimited API access, custom feeds

## Testing

- Spring Boot Test for integration testing
- TestContainers for InfluxDB, Redis, and Kafka integration testing
- WebTestClient for WebSocket and REST API testing
- Apache Kafka Test for streaming pipeline testing

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Test market data feed parsing and normalization for each exchange format
- Verify Kafka streaming pipeline handles high-volume data correctly
- Test WebSocket connection management under load (1000+ concurrent connections)
- Validate subscription tier access controls and rate limiting enforcement
- Test data quality monitoring and feed interruption handling
- Verify Redis caching performance and hit rates under load
- Test InfluxDB query performance for historical data retrieval
- Performance testing for 100,000+ price updates per second throughput
- Test market closure and holiday handling logic
- Validate data compliance with exchange licensing requirements

**Load Testing Scenarios:**
- Simulate peak market open volume (100,000+ updates/second)
- Test WebSocket connection stability under network interruptions
- Validate system behavior during exchange feed outages
- Test cache performance under high concurrent read loads
