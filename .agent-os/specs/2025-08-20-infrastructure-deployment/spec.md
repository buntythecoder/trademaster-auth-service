# Spec Requirements Document

## Overview

Deploy the TradeMaster authentication service to a production-ready AWS staging environment with PostgreSQL, Redis, Kong API Gateway, and comprehensive monitoring. This infrastructure foundation will enable reliable service delivery and seamless integration for future features while providing enterprise-grade security and observability.

## User Stories

### DevOps Engineer Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the authentication service to a staging environment, so that we can validate production readiness and provide a stable foundation for development and testing.

**Workflow:** The engineer configures AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code, deploys containerized services with proper networking and security, sets up monitoring and alerting systems, and validates the entire deployment pipeline from code commit to running services.

### Development Team Story

As a development team member, I want a reliable staging environment with monitoring and automated deployments, so that I can develop and test new features with confidence in a production-like environment.

**Workflow:** Developers push code changes which trigger CI/CD pipelines, deploy to staging automatically, receive monitoring feedback on service health, and can quickly identify and resolve issues using comprehensive observability tools.

### Product Owner Story

As a product owner, I want infrastructure that supports rapid feature development and reliable service delivery, so that we can meet our roadmap commitments and provide excellent user experience.

**Workflow:** Product owner reviews deployment metrics, monitors service availability and performance, receives alerts for critical issues, and makes informed decisions about feature releases based on infrastructure readiness.

## Spec Scope

1. **AWS Infrastructure Setup** - ECS cluster, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis with VPC networking and security groups
2. **Kong API Gateway Configuration** - Rate limiting, authentication, load balancing, and request routing
3. **Monitoring & Observability** - Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, and PagerDuty alerting
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, building, and deployment
5. **Security Configuration** - SSL certificates, secrets management, network security, and compliance logging
6. **Environment Management** - Staging environment with production-like configuration and data seeding

## Out of Scope

- Production environment deployment (will follow after staging validation)
- User data migration (no existing user data to migrate)
- Performance load testing (will be addressed in separate specification)
- Disaster recovery procedures (will be part of production deployment)
- Multi-region deployment (single region for staging)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional staging environment** accessible via HTTPS with TradeMaster auth service responding to API calls
2. **Monitoring dashboard** showing service health, database connections, and API response times in Grafana
3. **Automated CI/CD pipeline** that deploys code changes to staging environment with rollback capability
