# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-infrastructure-deployment/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### AWS Infrastructure Components
- **ECS Fargate Cluster** with service discovery and auto-scaling (2-10 tasks)
- **RDS PostgreSQL 14** in Multi-AZ configuration with backup and encryption
- **ElastiCache Redis 6** cluster mode with persistence and encryption in transit
- **Application Load Balancer** with SSL termination and health checks
- **VPC with private/public subnets** across 2 availability zones for high availability
- **Security groups** with minimal required access and database isolation
- **CloudWatch** integration for centralized logging and metrics collection

### Kong API Gateway Configuration  
- **Docker deployment** on ECS with persistent configuration storage
- **Rate limiting** plugin with tiered limits (100/1000/5000 req/min)
- **JWT authentication** plugin with token validation and refresh capability
- **CORS configuration** for frontend domain access with secure headers
- **Load balancing** across multiple auth service instances
- **Request/response transformation** for API versioning and compatibility
- **Health check endpoints** for service monitoring and automatic failover

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- **GitHub Actions** workflow with environment-specific deployments
- **Multi-stage pipeline** - test → build → deploy → verify
- **Automated testing** including unit tests, integration tests, and health checks
- **Blue-green deployment** strategy with automatic rollback on failure
- **Infrastructure as Code** using AWS CDK or Terraform with version control
- **Secrets management** using AWS Secrets Manager with rotation capability
- **Container registry** using ECR with vulnerability scanning

### Monitoring & Observability Stack
- **Prometheus** container on ECS for metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana** container with preconfigured dashboards for service monitoring
- **PagerDuty integration** for critical alert notifications and escalation
- **Custom metrics** for authentication rates, error rates, and response times
- **Application Performance Monitoring** with distributed tracing capability
- **Database monitoring** including connection pool, query performance, and backup status
- **Infrastructure monitoring** covering CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization

### Security & Compliance Configuration
- **SSL/TLS certificates** from AWS Certificate Manager with automatic renewal
- **WAF protection** against common web attacks and bot traffic
- **AWS Secrets Manager** for database passwords, API keys, and JWT secrets
- **VPC Flow Logs** for network traffic analysis and security monitoring
- **CloudTrail** for API call auditing and compliance logging
- **Network ACLs** and security groups following principle of least privilege
- **Encryption at rest** for RDS, Redis, and ECS task storage volumes

### Environment Configuration
- **Environment variables** management through AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- **Service mesh** configuration for secure inter-service communication
- **Database migrations** automated through Flyway in deployment pipeline
- **Configuration management** with environment-specific overrides
- **Logging configuration** with structured JSON logs and correlation IDs
- **Performance tuning** for JVM settings, connection pools, and caching strategies

## External Dependencies

- **AWS CDK** (v2.120.0+) - Infrastructure as Code deployment and management
- **Justification:** Provides type-safe infrastructure definitions with automated rollback capabilities

- **Prometheus** (v2.40+) - Metrics collection and monitoring system  
- **Justification:** Industry standard for microservices monitoring with powerful query capabilities

- **Grafana** (v10.0+) - Visualization and dashboards for monitoring data
- **Justification:** Best-in-class visualization for Prometheus metrics with alerting capabilities

- **Terraform** (v1.5+) - Alternative infrastructure provisioning tool
- **Justification:** Mature infrastructure as code with extensive AWS provider support

- **Docker** (v24.0+) - Container runtime and image building
- **Justification:** Required for ECS deployments and consistent environments
